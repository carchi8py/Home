# Lambda Temperature Notification

This project contains an AWS Lambda function that sends a text notification when the temperature at ZIP code 95117 goes below 65째F. The function ensures no duplicate notifications are sent unless the temperature rises above 65째F. It runs every 10 minutes using EventBridge.

## Environment Variables
To configure the Lambda function, set the following environment variables:

1. **`WEATHER_API_KEY`**: Your API key for the weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
   - Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get an API key.

2. **`SNS_TOPIC_ARN`**: The ARN of the SNS topic used to send notifications.
   - Create an SNS topic in AWS and subscribe your phone number to it.

## Steps to Set Up the Lambda Function

### 1. Create the Lambda Function
1. Go to the [AWS Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/).
2. Create a new Lambda function.
3. Upload the `lambda_temperature_notification.py` file as the function code.
4. Set the runtime to **Python 3.9** or later.
5. Configure the environment variables as described above.
6. Set the execution role to include permissions for:
   - **SNS Publish** (to send notifications).
   - **S3 Read/Write** (if using S3 for state storage).

### 2. Set Up EventBridge Rule
1. Go to the [AWS EventBridge Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/).
2. Create a new rule.
3. Set the rule to trigger every 10 minutes.
4. Add the Lambda function as the target.

### 3. Set Up SNS Topic
1. Go to the [AWS SNS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/).
2. Create a new topic (e.g., `TemperatureAlerts`).
3. Subscribe your phone number to the topic.
4. Note the topic's ARN and set it as the `SNS_TOPIC_ARN` environment variable in the Lambda function.

## Optional: Using S3 for State Storage
If you prefer to use S3 for storing the notification state:
1. Create an S3 bucket.
2. Update the Lambda function code to use S3 for state storage.
3. Grant the Lambda execution role permissions to read/write to the S3 bucket.

## Testing the Function
1. Manually invoke the Lambda function from the AWS Lambda Console.
2. Verify that the notification is sent when the temperature is below 65째F.
3. Check that no duplicate notifications are sent unless the temperature rises above 65째F.

## Costs
- **Lambda**: Pay per execution (free tier available).
- **SNS**: Pay per notification sent.
- **EventBridge**: Free for the first 1 million events per month.
- **S3 (if used)**: Minimal cost for storage and requests.
